<div class="about-content">

  <p>
    J.C. Trent writes dark military fantasy, not entirely by choice. He just
    doesn't know when to stop asking questions like "this makes no sense" and
    "why would anyone join the army if a wizard could blow up a mountain?"
    The answers to these questions are invariably horrible, and he cries at
    how much suffering they cause his characters.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he's not committing emotional terrorism on himself and his fictional
    soldiers, he's building overcomplicated build pipelines for his novels,
    because refactoring a few thousand lines of Python is way more productive
    than actually reviewing the line edits he paid a truly unreasonable amount
    of money for. The pipeline has never once made him cry, which is more than
    he can say for Chapter 28.
  </p>

  <p>
    He is a software engineer by trade, a writer by compulsion, and a
    resident of Phoenix, Arizona, where the weather is trying to kill him
    in a completely different way than his books.
