      <strong>To be seen is to be known.<br>To be known is to invite obliteration.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="book-card-blurb">
      On the Brynnland Front, they call Charlie-Three the Immortals — a platoon
      that walks out of battles that should have ground them to nothing. The army
      credits luck and good sergeants. The truth is Maren Vosk.
    </p>
    <p class="book-card-blurb">
      Trained by the Quiet School to deflect bullets and break minds without a
      sound, Maren is a weapon disguised as a soldier. His job: protect his
      platoon. His rule: never let them find out. Because a mage who is known
      becomes a target — and every man standing near him becomes collateral.
    </p>
    <p class="book-card-blurb">
      For eight months, the lie holds. He turns aside death while they credit
      luck. He watches their backs and refuses their friendship. He laughs at
      their jokes and buries the warmth before it can take root.
    </p>
    <p class="book-card-blurb">
      Then the Grinder comes. Cut off on a frozen hill, outnumbered and alone,
      Maren's quiet protections aren't enough. The enemy is designed to break
      him, and it's working.
    </p>
    <p class="book-card-blurb">
      Now he faces the only choice the Quiet School never prepared him for:
      keep hiding and watch his platoon die — or shatter every rule that keeps
      him alive, and save the men he loves by becoming the thing that will get
      them killed.
