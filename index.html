    <p class="hero-blurb">
      On the Brynnland Front, they call Charlie-Three the Immortals — a platoon
      that walks out of battles that should have ground them to nothing. The army
      credits luck and good sergeants. The truth is Maren Vosk.
    </p>
    <p class="hero-blurb">
      Trained to deflect bullets and break minds without a sound, Maren is a
      weapon disguised as a soldier. His job: protect his platoon. His rule:
      never let them find out. Because a mage who is known becomes a target —
      and every man standing near him becomes collateral.
